## Introduction

**PramaanPatra** is a decentralized certificate management system built on blockchain technology, aiming to securely generate, validate, and store vital certificates. From birth certificates to graduation certificates and land deed certificates, PramaanPatra ensures transparency, immutability, and efficiency in traditional certificate management.

## Features

  - Ether.js for connecting smart contracts with the frontend.
  - Transparent and secure transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.

- **Dynamic Certificate Records:**
  - Records dynamic and immutable histories of certificates.
  - Enhances trust and reliability by capturing the entire lifecycle of each document.

- **User Authentication and Management:**
  - Secure user registration and login system.
  - Database administrator capability to add and remove users manually.

- **Certificate Generation:**
  - Dynamic form creation for different certificate types.
  - Transaction phase facilitated through Metamask or other web3 providers.
  - Certificates generated in PDF format with QR code for verification.

- **Advantages Over Traditional Certificates:**
  - Increased trust and security with transparent transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.

### Blockchain Infrastructure

- Ethereum blockchain for smart contracts.
- Solidity for smart contract development.
- Ether.js to connect smart contracts with the frontend.
- Hardhat for Ethereum development environment (development purposes).
- Metamask or other web3 providers for transaction handling.

### Frontend

## Getting Started

<details>
  <summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

### Ethereum Smart Contracts

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests: `npx hardhat test`
3. Report gas usage: `REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test`
4. Start local Ethereum node: `npx hardhat node`
5. Deploy smart contracts: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js`

### Frontend

1. Change to the client directory: `cd client`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the React development server: `npm start`

### Backend

1. Change to the server directory: `cd server`
2. Run the Node.js server: `node index.js`

### Testnet

- Start a local Ethereum test node: `npx hardhat node`

### Blockchain Deployment

- Deploy on a local Ethereum network: `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js`

### MongoDB

1. Switch to the "sih" database: `use sih`
2. Retrieve all documents from the "users" collection: `db.users.find({})`
3. Delete all documents from the "users" collection: `db.users.deleteMany({})`

</details>

## Testing and Security

To ensure the reliability and security of PramaanPatra, rigorous testing is conducted across different components:

- **Smart Contracts Testing:**
  - Run unit tests using Hardhat: `npx hardhat test`

- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Execute React component tests: `npm test`

- **Security Audits:**
  - Regular security audits are conducted to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
